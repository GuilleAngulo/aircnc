# AirCnC
This app has 3 basic modules:
### Backend
Developed in NodeJS, is an API Rest to attend requests from the web version of the frontend as the mobile version.
This app has basically two pages: login and main. The backend of the app is developed in NodeJS, and the frontend is coded in two versions: one in React for browser client and another in React-Native for mobile-native client. Course produced by @RockeatSeat and teached by @diego3g.

## Login
In the login page the user will insert his Github nickname, which will create a new app user by getting his github basic data (Avatar, Bio, Username) using the public API.

## Main
In the main page, a list of users already registered is shown along with two buttons: "like" and "dislike". Both buttons turn off users profiles from current userÂ´s view, leaving only users without any interaction.
If two user do like one to each other, a match will show in the screen.
